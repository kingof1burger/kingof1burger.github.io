Welcome to my ticket aggregating website, VibePass. The website helps people in booking trips and vacations with the inclusion of all the requirements a person would need in a trip, including hotels, cruises, flights, food, activities, and other such activities.

My website consists of 6 main HTML web pages, 1 home page, 2 packages page, 1 contact page, 1 insurance page, and 1 about us page.

I have used only html,css and js on my page. For the functionality function i have made a fully working request and contact form, with an automated firsthand response system. I have also included in the website itself, the method by which a client can book tickets. In doing so i did not use any PHP or other coding languages, instead i used an application called 'Form Submit' which acts as the storage for all mails that i get.

All other buttons such as the buttons in hotels and packages page do not work but are only there with a design purpose in mind. I have used minor bootstrap as public libraries and help of google fonts in some places. Some css and js files such as the carousel and query.js were taken from public libraries with changes on my side.

The website is fully responsive on all devices and should also function just as well on all browsers as it did on my main browser.

Attached I have also given a video tour of the website.
