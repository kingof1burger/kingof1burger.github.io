Welcome to my ticket aggregating website, VibePass. The website helps people in booking trips and vacations with the inclusion of all the requirements a person would need in a trip, including hotels, cruises, flights, food, activities, and other such activities.
My website consists of 6 main HTML web pages, 1 home page, 2 packages page, 1 contact page, 1 insurance page, and one about us page.
I havr used only html,css and js on my page. For the functionality function i have made a fully working request and contact form, with an automated firsthand response system. I have also included in the website itself, the method by which a client can book tickets. In doing so i did not use any PHP or other coding languages, instead i used an application called 'Form Submit' which acts as the storage for all mails that i get.
All other buttons such as the buttons in hotels and packages page do not work but are only there with a design purpose in mind. I have used minor bootstrap as public libraries and help of google fonts in some places
